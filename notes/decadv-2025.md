# December Adventure 2025 (?)

another attempt at the low-key December Adventure though I feel I've had way too much and have enough of an adventure on the way. still, would like to try and write a little bit of fun nonsense code whenever I manage.

## 01

some ideas I'd like to explore...

- spending some time with rust...
  - bikesheddr
  - tedit
- migrating all my code off various services into an actual self hosted server.
- spending some time learning `jj`.
- a simple language with content addressable code, codebase as database, and simple predicate dispatching ... to much?

## 02

sneaked some time to port Mary Rose Cook's Little Lisp Interpreter into python. Kinda to get back into the swing of things and to perhaps use it as the building block of some of the other things I want to experiment with.

For example:
- can i add codebase as database features ?
- can i add objects and predicate dispatching methods ?
- can i make the code content addressable ?
- can i add types using something like [this](https://jimmyhmiller.com/easiest-way-to-build-type-checker) ?

little lisp is fairly straightforward to implement (specially in python) and all so I can get to the things I want to play with fairly fast... and if time and energy permits then perhaps apply whatever is learned into some of the slightly more involve languages (that aren't lisps)
