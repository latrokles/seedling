# December Adventure 2025 (?)

another attempt at the low-key December Adventure though I feel I've had way too much and have enough of an adventure on the way. still, would like to try and write a little bit of fun nonsense code whenever I manage.

## 01

some ideas I'd like to explore...

- spending some time with rust...
  - bikesheddr
  - tedit
- migrating all my code off various services into an actual self hosted server.
- spending some time learning `jj`.
- a simple language with content addressable code, codebase as database, and simple predicate dispatching ... to much?
